            I was born in Poland on June 7, 1985 and lived most of my life in Windsor, Ontario. I recently moved to Toronto (around 2010) with my beautiful girlfriend Sonja and have been living here ever since.

            I am currently learning how to program in JavaScript and other technologies that are closely related including 3D Rendering with WebGL/ThreeJS. I'm always learning and spend most of my time on the computer, reading and trying all sorts of new technologies. I've been contributing to Mozilla's Firefox Metro project (RIP!!) since October 2012 and became a full time employee in February 2014. One of my goals at Mozilla is to work on more technical aspects that involve programming.
