================

I will be creating/working on this blog while I'm learning JavaScript and will be using the following technologies:

- JavaScript, node.js, express, Jade, Markdown, redis
- Planning on eventually incorporating several other technologies such as WebGL, three.js and canvas while my JS skills improve

If anyone has any suggestions or criticism, please let me know via the bug section or you can email me directly at kamiljoz [at] gmail.com
